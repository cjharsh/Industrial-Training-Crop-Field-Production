# Industrial-Training-Crop-Yield-Production
The training work involves this project which predicts the crop yield for a particular crop.
This project is a part of a major project which involved crop yield of five different cities,
this project predicts crop yield for Gazipur district of Uttar Pradesh based on various
parameters such as area of land, previous year yiels, rainfall etc. Out of various crops,
Rice is chosen as India and specifically Gazipur is a major producer of Rice.
The Machine Learning model used is in this project is Linear Regression, on the Data Set
Gazipur.csv. The model is imported from sklearn library of python. Rest other libraries are
numpy, matplotlib, pprint and pandas. Python is used as the Language because it has
vast libraries for mathematical and scientific computation, and was bit easy to use
compared to other languages like R because of prior familiarity.
The project is basically aimed to learn the first model of supervised machine leaning. This
project also involves good use of sklearn and numpy libraries, so it provides good
exposure to both the python library. Any platform where python is operable can be used
to run this project.
